        <h2>What is Pokemon TCG Pocket Trading?</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em> is a mobile app where you collect digital Pokemon cards and,
          since 2025, can trade them with friends. The in-game trading system has some restrictions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can only trade with players on your friends list.</li>
          <li>
            Cards must be of the same rarity (e.g., a 2-Diamond card for another 2-Diamond card).
          </li>
          <li>
            Certain cards (like promos, new releases, or above 1-Star rarity) are not tradable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trading requires resources: Trade Stamina and, for rare cards, Trade Tokens or
            Shinedust.
          </li>
          <li>Both players must agree to the trade.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>How Our Website Helps You Trade</h2>
        <p>
          Since you can only trade with friends in-game,
          <strong><a href="https://pokemon-tcg.exchange">pokemon-tcg.exchange</a></strong> acts as a
          matchmaking and management tool:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Build your wishlist:</strong> Select the cards you want from the game catalog.
          </li>
          <li><strong>List your offers:</strong> Mark the cards you’re willing to give away.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enter your Friend ID:</strong> Your unique in-game identifier, so others can add
            you as a friend and trade.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Get matched:</strong> The site finds users whose offers and wishes match yours,
            showing their Friend IDs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Manage trades:</strong> See proposals, track negotiations, and update your
            wishlist or offers at any time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This makes it easy to find trustworthy trading partners and organize trades that the
          in-game system alone does not facilitate.
